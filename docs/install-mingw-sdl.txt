Short notice how to install mingw32 sdl on linux.

1. Install mingw
2. Find out:
    * What's the name of the compiler (e.g. i586-mingw32-gcc)
    * What's the mingw directory (e.g. /usr/i586-mingw32)
3. Configure SDL like that (maybe you want to install dx first):
    ./configure --host=i586-mingw32
4. make
5. Then just install - but:
   make PREFIX=/usr/i586-mingw32/ install

Happy coding
