Neosam's gametools

These project is a summary of c funtions for game programming and cross
compiling using mingw32.

I hope it's useful for you.

Makefile and tools/winmake
--------------------------
You can use this Makefile for cross compiling.  Just set HOST, SDL_BIN_PREFIX
and BIN_SUFFIX to get a win32 exe.  If this is too much work for you then
just edit tools/winmake and type winmake instead of make.
